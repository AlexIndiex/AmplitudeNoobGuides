Starting guide for new EmuDeck users on Deck:
- Files and programs you need:
 - [EmuDeck](<https://www.emudeck.com/#download>)
 - Bios files (needed for PS1, PS2, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo DS/DSi, Sega CD, Saturn and DreamCast emulation)
 - Roms files (for the systems you want to emulate)
 - Free storage (either on your internal storage, microSD or external storage)
 - An internet connection (kinda obvious)
- Other things you might need:
 - Dock or hub (for multiple devices connection)
 - Mouse and keyboard (useful for navigation)
 - External drive (either for moving files or using it for EmuDeck)
 - [Synchthing](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzix6-uKTA0>) (if you care for synching files between different PCs)
 - [Warpinator](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHdQT6kI6Q8>) and [Winpinator](<https://github.com/swiszczoo/winpinator>) (if you dont have an external drive to move your files)
 - Mods and cheats (you either rely on communities or other sites)
 - [EmuDeckWiki](<https://emudeck.github.io/>) for any other kind of help or reference
 - [Compatibility list](<https://brantje.github.io/emudeck-compatibility-list/>) from EmuDeck's users
 - [EmuDeck's Discord server](<https://discord.gg/b9F7GpXtFP>) for any other help
 - [DeckyLoader](<https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader>) for PowerTools (it can be installed with EmuDeck)

Now lets get started with the installation process:
- Initial EmuDeck installation:
 - In DesktopMode, download [EmuDeck.desktop](<https://www.emudeck.com/#download>) and move it to your desktop window
 - Double click it, its gonna start installing EmuDeck (and only EmuDeck), you gonna notice from the previous file being replaced with a new one with the EmuDeck logo, once it finishes its going to open the program for you
 - Select either quick or custom installation, the difference between the two is the ability to choose what emulators you want to install, the first one install everything EmuDeck offers support for, while with the second you can just install what emulators you care for
 - Select where you want to install your emulation folder, (the emulators you want if you chose custom installation on the starting screen), (the emulators you want to get updated if you chose custom installation on the starting screen), the aspect ratio for your emulators (i would recommend using the original aspect ratio of each system so you wont encounter graphical glitches), the EmulationStation's theme, whatever you want homebrew games or not, now click the finish button and let EmuDeck install everything you chosen
 - After the installation its done, click done, now dont bother with the add games section, its gonna prompt again the installation process for the device where you have your files and its gonna ask you to move your files in the correct folders, which you can do on your own without redoing everything again, so skip it, now close EmuDeck

Its time to move your files:
- [DISCLAIMER] In this section i will tell you where to move your files with an external drive since its the fastest way to do it, if want to do it in any other way, please refer to the embed links in [Synchthing](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzix6-uKTA0>), [Warpinator](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHdQT6kI6Q8>) and [Winpinator](<https://github.com/swiszczoo/winpinator>):
 - Open Dolphin, the file explorer, not the emulator, and navigate to your drive where you installed EmuDeck, you gonna find a folder named Emulation, right click on it and open it in a new tab, while you are in it open a new tab for both bios and roms folders, now return to the first tab and open the drive where you have the files you want to move, now you should have 4 tabs, the drive of your files, the emulation folder, bios folder and roms folder, you can close the emulation folder if you dont have any kind of save file or texture pack to move
 - You can start moving your bios files from your drive to the bios folder, the only files that need a deeper location is your Nintendo Switch's keys and firmware files, that you can move in both Yuzu and Ryujinx folder (Ryujinx needs the firmware installed instead), (for any other emulator please refer to the [EmuDeckWiki](<https://emudeck.github.io/>)) 
 - You can start moving your roms from your drive to the roms folder, inside of it you going to find out that each system has a folder for its roms, you can read a text file inside each of them to know what roms' format each emulator supports, i would recommend creating an update folder for modern systems (like 3DS, WiiU, Switch, PS3, Xbox360, Xbox) that support update roms for your games in /Emulation/roms/ (please pay attention to folder like WiiU, you gonna find another rom folder inside of it, you need to move your roms there instead of just /Emulation/roms/wiiu/)

You can now open again EmuDeck and start installing extra programs you might need to get everything working in the best way: 
- [DISCLAIMER] Please install [DeckyLoader](<https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader>) to use PowerTools and DeckyControls
 - Lets start by checking your bios files, select the bios checker section and make sure the box for the emulators you need a bios for is green, if it's not make sure it isnt corrupted or damaged by redumping it again
 - If you want to use the gyro controls for emulators that need it or support it, open the gyroscope section, you gonna need a sudo password, if you have not set a password, this page will prompt you to create one, insert it and click install, once the terminal closes, you can go back to the main page
 - Next, you gonna need PowerTools for emulators like Yuzu and Dolphion-emu, mainly to disable smt, the multi-thread process of Deck's APU, since in SteamOS 3.4 it's bugged, go to the PowerTools section and install it the same way as the gyroscope section (same process for DeckyControls, a plugin to quickly check each emulator controls and hotkeys)
 - For better WiiU emulation i would recommend installing Cemu native, known as Cemu appimage, you can get it in manage emulators>cemu>install cemu appimage
 - Add your emulators and roms to Steam with SteamRomManager so you will be able to play them in GamingMode, there is a shortcut in the initial page of EmuDeck, click it, it's going to prompt that it's closing Steam for you, if your controls dont work after clicking yes please use a mouse to navigate your Deck for this process, wait for SteamRomManager to boot, once it opens go to settings>theme>change it from emudeck to classic for easier navigation, you can either leave everything on or turn off the toggle parsers' toggle and turn on only the toggles for the systems you want to add to Steam, once you down choosing, click preview>parse, wait for the programs to retrieve the urls for the artworks, once its done, click save to steam, now click on the log tab and wait for SteamRomManager to finish saving everything to Steam, once its done, close it, and open Steam.
 - You can now either go back to GamingMode, installing your roms updates for your emulators, or fixing Dolphin-emu and Yuzu gyro controls, for this last point please refer to the following links:
